Shrek:
For your information, there's a lot more to ogres than people think.

Donkey:
Example?

Shrek:
Example? Okay, um, ogres are like onions.

Donkey:
[Sniffs] They stink?

Shrek:
Yes-- No!

Donkey:
They make you cry?

Shrek:
No!

Donkey:
You leave them out in the sun, they get all brown, start sproutin' little white hairs.

Shrek:
No! Layers! Onions have layers. Ogres have layers! Onions have layers. You get it? We both have layers. [Sighs]

Donkey:
Oh, you both have layers. Oh. [Sniffs] You know, not everybody likes onions. Cakes! Everybody loves cakes! Cakes have layers.

Shrek:
I don't care what everyone likes. Ogres. Are not. Like cakes.
